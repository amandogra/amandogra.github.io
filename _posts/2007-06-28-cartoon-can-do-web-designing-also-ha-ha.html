This time I am adding Some of my Designs which I have created from scratch.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_s5GVahsJtq0/RoNxakZWY9I/AAAAAAAAAEw/CdRcyw5IBPo/s1600-h/Design+SunFlower.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_s5GVahsJtq0/RoNxakZWY9I/AAAAAAAAAEw/CdRcyw5IBPo/s320/Design+SunFlower.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5081029505864590290" border="0" /></a>The Sunflower Design is the oldest of all these three and I like it most. It took a lots of time. I was at the basic level of CSS at that time. Alot has chaged since then :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_s5GVahsJtq0/RoNxa0ZWY-I/AAAAAAAAAE4/Ucst4fnNO6s/s1600-h/Design5+.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_s5GVahsJtq0/RoNxa0ZWY-I/AAAAAAAAAE4/Ucst4fnNO6s/s320/Design5+.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5081029510159557602" border="0" /></a>This is a proposed design for 'Insignia of Eminence', our still on dreams company :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_s5GVahsJtq0/RoNxbEZWY_I/AAAAAAAAAFA/TyFOTcxmcwA/s1600-h/Design_IE.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_s5GVahsJtq0/RoNxbEZWY_I/AAAAAAAAAFA/TyFOTcxmcwA/s320/Design_IE.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5081029514454524914" border="0" /></a><br />This was the old design for the iEminence , short for 'Insignia of Eminence' yet registered. Actually both these names are our trademarks (again in dreams) so don't try to copy them otherwise I can sue you  :)<br />The journey doesn't end here, I have a lots of designs and as soon I'll get time again I'll put them on the web. Keep looking up ... Enjoy!
