<p>Among the many awesome features of CSS3, there is a feature known as 'placeholder'. Placeholder is a text which is displayed inside the input text box on HTML page. You must have seen something like.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_115" align="alignnone" width="138"]<a href="http://amandogra.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screen-shot-2012-08-25-at-2-32-40-pm.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-115" title="Placeholder" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2012-08-25-at-2-32-40-pm.png" alt="placeholder" width="138" height="41" /></a> A placeholder text inside the input box[/caption]</p>
<p>This can be achieved very easily by adding &lt;input type="text" Â placeholder="Name"/&gt;. But the issue is that each browser handled it differently. There are browsers like IE (ahem) which do not support it and there are browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari, which support 'placeholder' but has different behavior towards it.</p>
<p>For example, in Firefox, default color of the placeholder is black while in it is silver in Chrome or Safari. Moreover when we click/focus on the input box, it disappears immediately. I like the placeholder handling done by Safari.</p>
<p>In Safari, when the user clicks on the input box the placeholder text does not goes away. It only disappears when user enters some value inside the text-box</p>
<p>So, here is the jsFiddle for the placeholder. It's a simple jQuery plugin which you can understand just by looking at it.</p>
