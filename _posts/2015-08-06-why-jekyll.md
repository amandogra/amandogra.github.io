Jekyll is a tool for transforming your plain text into static websites and 
blogs. It is simple, static, and blog-aware. Jekyll uses the 
[Liquid](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics) templating
language and has builtin [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
and [Textile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)) support.

It also ties in nicely to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

##Why I used Jekyll?
Now the question arises why I used Jekyll. Short answer is just to learn a new thing. Long answer is 
my friend [Rakesh](https://github.com/rakeshjuyal) told me about it few days ago and said that he would like to know how it works.
I gave it a shot, googled for few minutes, found [tutorial] (http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-jekyll--cms-20956) and after
few minutes was having a page at [Github](http://amandogra.github.io). I showed it to Rakesh and he was impressed.

But I was not as it was a static ugly page and I didn’t add any post at that time. After few days, I saw a person creating a complete
website using jekyll, terminal and vim only. That impressed me and intrigued me to do something similar. I was already learning vim. I was also 
experimenting with iTerm2 and oh-my-zsh. Well I created this blog or website using only these tools. I am writing this post also in vim. Using the terminal,
I’ll publish it and if you are seeing it then that means I learnt and built something new. Now it’s your turn.
