Macromedia [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/) is one of my
favorite tools. After a long time I got chance to do my favorite thing
using this tool. Drawing. Although drawing on a software is not as
awesome as it is on a paper with a pen, but yes the fun is very much
similar. I'll try to post some step by step tutorial to do so sometime
later.

So all you guys be ready, because after me now it is your turn to be
tooned. I'm not sure who is next, but one by one I'm gonna toon you all.
Sounds like I have become a magician who is ready to jinx you all. I
know I suck at metaphors, but I'm sure you got my point.

Have fun!
