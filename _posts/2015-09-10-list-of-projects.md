This is a list which I am planning to move to `_projects` folder in future.

Fuel Economy (Mileage)
---------
I am not sure about US, but in India many people are concerned about the average or mileage of their vehicles. I am creating an app as a sideproject which could calculate and store your fuel economy.
I have bought a small server on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) and am running this [test app](http://104.131.183.137:3000/) on that server.


ViM like editor
---------
Create an editor using python/JS which behaves on the concepts of ViM. I have forked a [repo](https://github.com/amandogra/HappyEdit) on github which is an attempt to create a vim on web. I’ll exprore more.
I have also found that the Atom editor has a [plugin](https://github.com/carlosdcastillo/vim-mode) which uses neovim. [NeoVim](http://neovim.io/) looks promising. Have to explore more.


Online course
-------------
Create an online course in JS. `Javascript in Hinglish`.I even thought of something like guru-shishya or gurukul. A place where you could learn one skill in exchange of another. More you teach, more ‘mana’ you earn. Then you could spend this ‘mana’ on learning new skills.
