*The Vault* is an internal application which is used by one of the Apple marketing inventory management teams. Around the launch time for any Apple product, few items are distributed to the editors and critics for testing. This application keeps track of all those inventory items.

This application uses CSS flex-box extensively for the layout. It has two sections each facing the customer and the administrator. I have worked on both the sections. We created our own javascript framework for this application.

Technologies used:

-   Javascript
-   jQuery
-   HTML5
-   CSS3
-   SASS (Compass)
