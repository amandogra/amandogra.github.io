You want to find an Apple store or Apple authorized reseller, consultant or service provider, you could use Apple's Global Resource Locator application.

<!--more-->

Apple's Global Resource Locator (or GRL in short) is a map application which helps the users in finding an Apple retail or authorized store.

I worked on the very first version of this application. We used Google Maps at that time in this application. Later that was replaced with Apple Maps. A simple store locator jquery library was created for this application.

Technologies used:

-   Javascript
-   jQuery
-   HTML5
-   CSS
