<http://bhaktiwomen.org>

It is a side project, which I have been working on for the last few months. BhaktiWomen is a community of spiritually inclined women. They are a simple team of Krishna Bhakti-followers in Seattle, USA who share the desire to devote their lives wholly to please Krishna through our Bhakti as women.

They needed a fresh website. Their old website was hosted on Drupal. The website was ported from Drupal to Wordpress. A new theme was created for the same in Wordpress.

Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- PHP
- Wordpress
