## ACT:
\[Kallu and Gappu meet after a few months in market and start gossiping
about different things\]

**Kallu**: Man! what have you told to Tikku about marriage, he's now scared
to shit and have refused to marry for another five years.

**Gappu**: Don't laugh man! you're going to be married soon... then you'll
be calling me from the bathroom and share your sad-stories with me.

**Kallu**: I don't understand... Sad stories??

**Gappu**: Yes my dear friend! no matter how much beautiful your wife is,
you are going to get bored of her in six months. You don't believe me,
ask [Abhishek Bacchan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Bacchan).

**Kallu**: What are you saying brother? I man can never get bored of his
wife. After all a man's libido never dies.

**Gappu**: Yes! but you can't eat same food daily to satisfy your appetite.
For the first 2 months you are like one soul two bodies, always trying
to be one body... all the time you are high, but after a period of six
months a peck on a cheek is like climbing Mount Everest.

**Kallu**: How come? What brings so much of a change in so less of a time?

**Gappu**: Her policing... Where are you? Have you taken lunch? When are you
coming home? Are you drinking? Are you smoking? Are you with those
filthy friends of yours? Have you bought the curtains I have asked you
for? Are they of the same color? ... and a ton of more such shitty
questions which leave you with no time for yourself. What am I... her
pet?

**Kallu**: But I guess this is because she cares? She loves you?

**Gappu**: No... more than that she HATES the idea of me enjoying with
somebody 'else'. I am sure, every once in a while a wife dreams of her
husband in the arms of another hot chick and that is the moment when she
calls you... just to be sure.

**Kallu**: (smirking) that means you go around?

**Gappu**: (stoically) Do you think this little device (pointing towards
cell phone) can let me go anywhere? Sometimes I think this thing has
become another organ of mine. Bring me that jerk who invented this
device. I severe, I'll kill him and if he is dead, I'll revive him to
kill him again.

**Kallu**: I guess girls feel more secure when they are talking to a man
over phone.

**Gappu**: Security? Yeah! Telephone is an assurance that the man is still
under your control. It's like a collar in the dog's neck.

**Kallu**: Men are Dogs (Ha Ha Ha)

**Gappu** (laughs aloud) Yeah! so true. Stray dogs chained to their spouses
(Ha Ha Ha)

**Kallu**: I think bro! you create a lot of fiasco about the marriage.
You're exaggerating, it's not as hard if you just care about her.

**Gappu**: Care? Let me screw your 'care' thing. Suppose you are roaming
with her in a mall. She is wearing this really hot dress and her bosom
is ready to come out any time. And then out of no where some punks pass
by squinting at her assets and commenting the same way you used to do
when you were in college. Then what?

**Kallu**: I'll try to ignore it, thinking that they are just kids, I've
also done a lot of that shit while I was in college or something like
that.

**Gappu**: No man! she is your lady... How can you ignore this? Where is
your "care" man! She might be expecting something from you. She may want
you to do 'something', after all you are her MAN. You should do
something heroic... kind of save her from the bad guys. That's another
fantasy every woman have... 'Her man fighting 10-20 guys to save her
from any damn thing'

**Kallu**: I'll bash the guys up.

**Gappu**: Hey! you ain't superman. You can't fight everybody in the street.
Like you said earlier, Men are Dogs. How many of them would you stray
off?

**Kallu**: I'll tell her not to waer such HOT dresses.

**Gappu**: Here... here you broke the ice... you blew the bubble here. Ha
Ha. You can NEVER EVER tell her NOT to dress in a way she wants. This
makes you narrow-minded... at least in her eyes :)

**Kallu**: (confusingly)This is very... weird.

**Gappu**: There is more to it. Throughout the way she'll keep telling you,
"that man is not dressed well" or "The dress of that boy is really cool"
or "the girl is looking really cheap in that dress" BUT man if she
catches you having even a glimpse of a chick around you... then God save
you that night.

**Kallu**: You are exaggerating again Gappu!

**Gappu**: Not at all man! moreover if she is looking at a jewelry item or a
footwear, then be sure that she wants you to give that item as a
surprise gift to her, and that also before you want to go to bed with
her next time.

**Kallu**: (slapping his hand in the air) Beat it man! She is the
house-holder so what if she wants something. You should be generous
enough to give that.

**Gappu**: House-holder? Your own house becomes a hell once you are married.
If your old ones have some problem with her, they'll never say this to
her. They'll keep on squinting you or whispering in your ears, "Can't
you handle her?", "Can't you tell her that this is not done". On the
other hand, if she's not liking something about your mother, she'll not
tell this to her mother-in-law, instead she'll tell you... YOU mother's
son! What the 'F' man! Why don't they talk to each other directly, What
am I? A kind of messenger or something?

**Kallu**: Gappu! the thing is they both love you a lot, that's why they are
both jealous of each other. it's quite normal... just feminine.

**Gappu**: (throwing his hands up in the air) Yeah! the greatest irony of
the life... Two females who claim to love you the most, make your life a
living HELL.

**Kallu**: Whatever you say brother, one can not live without marriage.

**Gappu**: Sounds like... One can not live without sex. But trust me man,
sex has nothing to do with the marriage...

**Kallu**: but love has...?

**Gappu**: Forget it! even 'love' has nothing to do with marriage. It's only
a compromise. If two people, with nothing in common, just make
themselves believe that "this is it, you have no way out, just bear it,
keep smiling", then they are going to be called the good, happy couple.
Otherwise, you know what...

**Kallu**: I agree... but there is something where I disagree... You said
love has nothing to do with it. I guess 'no', as a few months back I had
to stay in the hospital as I met an accident...

**Gappu**: Yes! I remember, I also visited you there

**Kallu**: ...Ya...there I saw a Man who was hardly more than 27 years, was
having a number of multiple fractures through-out his body. And there
was his wife, taking care of him, dressing him, feeding him and helping
him in everything, as you could see he was not able to get out of his
bed. Nobody was there to help her. Man's parents were too old to serve
him. His siblings used to visit him often but... everybody is busy
nowadays. She was about 24 or may be 25, but she was so selflessly
serving her husband that I saw a lot of improvement in that man's
condition in just a week. I stayed there for only one week. So what was
it? Wasn't it love?

**Gappu**: These are the times for which we are forced by our parents to
marry, if we are not interested in so called 'love' of our lives.
Everybody is going to have ups and downs in the life. As human we are
social animals, in our merry-times we need somebody to celebrate with
and in our down-times we need somebody's shoulder to cry on. Friends are
there, but they have their own lives, they can not be there forever.
Parents grow old by the time you have to face the real difficulties of
the life. At that time my dear friend! you feel the need for a partner.
Who has time for you, shoulder for you plus the sex is bonus ;)
BUT
let me tell you a little secret... Men don't love, they just can NEVER
EVER love. Their logical brains just can NOT interpret such a
complex-out-of-logic thing called 'love'. They just get responsible,
more 'loyal'... as you said, 'Men are dogs'
