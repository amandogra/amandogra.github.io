We are all fascinated by the magic... by miracles. We all know that
everybody else gets impressed by the magic. We all want to do the magic.
That's why we keep telling people,"See! I did it" but we always try to
hide,"How?". <!--more--> Because that is the trick. And if that trick is told then
the magic is gone. You would NOT be considered wizard.\
If the boss assigns a work and stand over your head, you'll not be able
to perform. Nobody wants to be monitored. Because that ruins the trick.
Everybody wants to say,"Assign work and I'll give the results".
Everybody wants to keep the secret within. The secret of converting task
to result.

If your loved one asks you,"How do you know that chocolate is my
favorite?" You'll never say,"It is liked by every girl" or you won't
tell,"It was just a coincidence". You'll tell her,"I just know you". You
were just being the magician hiding the truth.

Everybody wants to be the magician, the dexterous wizard. Those who
don't want to be wizards, become spectators in this arena called life.
Much better wizard means, you know more tricks than others. More tricks
you know, more successful you are. More success... more magic.

We see magic in our daily life. We see children growing. We see trees
getting taller. Flowers blossoming everywhere around us. But we are so
blind to appreciate this magic. Magic is everywhere around. We are just
busy enough to appreciate it.

I drew this sketch on a whiteboard in the office while having a Hi-Tea
Party in the celebration for Holi. It was less than 5 minutes effort.
I'll try to convert it into vector-image soon, may be after holi. By the
way, it's today... Happy HOLI!!! :)
