Year 2008 is a history now. We have left it behind but, the memories are
still fresh. Like anybody I else can say, "A lot has happened to me in
this year". In this post I am posting some of the photographs of the
last trip which I had to my home.

Office is a boredom now. The environment and the politics at the workplace sucks now. May be it's due to the global frustration which is happening around due to the
recession. World is becoming a bad-place-to-live-in day by day. But
still there is a lot to see in this planet. Like the picture above is a
place in Kangra, which you can see if you can risk parking your car in
the middle of a curvaceous road. I always wanted to capture this scene
on camera.

This picture is of the narrow gauge rail running between Pathankot and Joginder
Nagar. This is one of the oldest rails laid in Himachal Pradesh. This
one was laid when India was a british colony and was ruled by the
Englishmen. Sometimes I think that all the progress which our state has
made was in that rule, after that we became a set of poor people
somehow. I am not sure how, but I truely want to see it more prosperous
than it ever was. Amen!
