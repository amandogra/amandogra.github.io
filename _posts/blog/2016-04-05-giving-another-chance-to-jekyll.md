I believe in second chances. Keeping that tradition, I decided to give Jekyll another try. I found this great  Jekyll template called [Skinny Bones](http://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/). I used that template to resolve some of the issues I was having with my Jekyll blog.

The theme was very different from what I have in my blog. But the thing I liked was the idea of separation of categories. Following is the summary of what I liked about Skinny Bones and why I am keeping my blog in Jekyll for now.

- **Categories**: As you can see in this blog that there are two types of posts 'Blog' and 'Work'. In code they are two separate categories. Posts related to 'blog' are put under `_posts/blog` folder while those related to 'work' are in `_posts/work` folder. I learnt that we could loop through the posts using categories. e.g., `site.categories.blog` will loop through 'blog' category posts only.

- **Comments**: Using the skinny bones template one could easily configure the [disqus](https://disqus.com/home/explore/) comments solution. It's as simple as configuring a setting in `_config.yml`

- **kramdown** Although I like markdown, but Github Pages is using kramdown. They are similar except some differences which one could find [here](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html). Skinny Bones by default using kramdown. I was using [redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) earlier but everytime I was pushing to github, I was getting a warning email that redcarpet would be deprecated soon. So it is better to use kramdown. The only hassle is that now I have to change all my \`\`\` into ~~~~ for the code fencing.

- **SASS** It is using sass. Which is awesome for obvious reasons. My blog was using SASS so it was easier to setup the styles.

There are loads of readymade pluggable code snippets in Skinny Bones which I am not using in my blog, but it is good start I think.

The pagination is still the elephant in the room. I still have no solution for showing pagination on different categories. I guess the author of Skinny Bones (unable to find his/her name) has also not found any solution for that. I'll keep looking though.
