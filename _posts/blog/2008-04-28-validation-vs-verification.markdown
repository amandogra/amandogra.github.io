I spent a few hours on the book 'Software Engineering - A
Practitioner's guide' by Roger S. Pressman. I was reading the chapter
'Testing Strategies', when I found some really interesting facts related
to Validation and Verification. There is a strong divergence of opinion
about what is 'validation' testing.

<!--more-->

Some people say that all testing is
verification and the validation is conducted when the requirements are
reviewed and approved, and when the system is operational, then user
validates it. Other people believe that the unit and integration testing
is verification and higher-order testing is validation. So overall-\

**Verication** is:
Are we building the product Right?

**Validation** is:
Are we building the right product?

I also found a beautiful quote today related to testing

> The first mistake that people make is thinking that the testing team
> is responsible for assuring quality

Well! we all are responsible for the quality of the product.
