Well! I was watching television at Didi's place and noticed that
whenever we are watching television in a group (read in family) then
there is a continuous fight for 'the' remote control. Why so? What do
you think why everybody wants to keep that small box in their own hands?
<!--more-->

I think because everybody craves for control. Everybody wants to control
the television. Everybody loves power and that small box known as
'remote control' gives you a sense of power, a power to control. That
reminds me of a thought which says that we all are controlled. We all
are in the illusion that everything is in our control and we can control
it. We think that we can control everything, but can we?

Put every question aside, just answer a simple question, can you control yourself?
Well I was looking at my picture which was just a decade old. I saw that
I had too much of hair over my head at that time. I was so lean and so
young. I see at that picture and felt like that kid is dead. I am never
going to be the one which I was ten years ago. I can't control it. I
can't control even myself. I am being controlled and that makes me
nauseated. We spend all of our lives to get a little more control over
our lives. Every bit of time we try to control the people around us,
people we love, people we despise. But the irony is we are running
behind our own tails. We are being... remote controlled. I don't know by
whom.

Once more I have tried my hands on caricaturing. This time again the
target is one of my colleagues. Vaibhav Sharma is in my team and I am honored to have him by my side. He is the angry chimp of my team especially when it comes to girls. He just can't stand them but can't even live without them. That's why is also
known as 'The Terrorist'. A rash driver, a defected piece, a slide mind
but overall a good friend.
