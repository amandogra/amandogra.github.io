Life can be lived in two ways -

1.  *Sab kucch theek ho jayega* means that "Everything will be alright"
2.  *Sab kucch theek hai* means that"Everything is alright

<!--more-->

Either we can spend our lives waiting for a new dawn which will come
through the darkest hours of our nights and spread up as happiness into
our lives or we can keep on living like nothing bad is going on and all
we have is now. All the happiness is now. There is nothing like a
happiness which is to be found in the future.

Both these sentences are complete in themselves and in a sense both are
incomplete. We can go on living with hopes for a better tomorrow or we
can go on living with no awareness about tomorrow.

I think we should leave all those philosophical talks for now and
concentrate on the item from the carton of the cartoon.

This picture is of my own kitchen garden in the backyard of my home. It was
the sunlight which attracted me. A sunny morning in the winters is
nothing but a precious gift.
