This is the time when India is enjoying (and few are cursing) the
fact that 'Slumdog Millionaire' has won 8 Oscars. I am really proud and
happy for A. R. Rehman.

I have always adored his music. He must be enjoying the winning of two oscars and my roommate Narin is enjoying his engagement ;) Yeah! Yeah! he got engaged. This happened on Saturday. While I was watching DevD and fantasizing, he was actually talking to
'his girl for life'. He seemed happy when he talked to me, but like any
other guy, he was afraid as his days of freedom are going to be over
soon. With such a large circle of friends as he has got... this is
really an issue for consideration, but life is a set of changes.

'We have been roommates for about eight years, now it's going to change', I
told him. He said, 'It will take at least an year and maybe, by then
you'll be married too. We'll continue to go for family tours.'

We all keep on planning, through out our lives. Even when we die, a
millions of plans remain unattended in our minds. So many plans and so
many failures. So much pain. In short, throughout our lives we plan to
get hurt.

Cartoons don't plan, they go with the wind. They are just a window to
whatever has happened or is happening around, with no future and... no
plan.

The College Library is best place to see the blooming of half of the college
love affairs. You doubt that? Remember your college library or go to
your college library \[if you are still student\], you'll find the
topper of your class touching the guy besides her carelessly at places
and vice-versa ;)
