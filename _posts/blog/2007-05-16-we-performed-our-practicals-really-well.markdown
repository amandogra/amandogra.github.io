Through out the engineering one has to perform many experiments... We
also performed them and we really performed them well. watch out urself.
This was FM(Fluid Mechanics) lab. I don't know they r teaching this
subject to Computer Science Students or not but they use to teach it in
the first year. Jujhar Singh used to teach us FM. nice man!
