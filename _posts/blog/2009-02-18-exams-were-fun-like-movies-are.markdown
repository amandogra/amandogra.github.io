Yesterday I saw two movies... 'Seven Pounds' and 'Momento'. Both the
movies have one thing in common... 'dead wife'. One more thing was
common... 'Awesome presentation'. It has always fascinated me, the way
directors (or editors) play with the time quotient in such kind of
movies.

'Will Smith' is really great actor. It's not like that I haven't
liked his acting skills in 'MIB' or 'Independence Day', but the movie
which made him much better actor in my eyes was 'Hitch'. It seems to me
that I watch too many movies. Day before yesterday, I was watching
'Something gotta get' starring 'Jack Nicholas'. That movie was really
lovely.

The item posted above is another tribute to the Examinations. I have always
loved exams as they have always given me a feeling that I am cool. ;)
