There was a person from Bihar, named 'Bhola', who used to work for my
grandfather. He worked for more than forty years as a servile to my
grandfather. During this time, he visited his own home in Bihar only
eight times. The maximum number of days he was allowed to spend in Bihar
were fifteen, which he availed only once, for his daughter's marriage.<!--more-->
Most of the times he was called back from his home before the end of his
approved vacation time. I once asked my grandfather that why Bhola is
not allowed to spend time with his family at his home. My grandfather
answered, '*Naukro ko naukro ki tarah rakhna chahiye. Agar hum ise
jayada cchoot de denge to yeh bhag jayega.*' \[Servants should be
treated like servants. If we'll give him more liberty, he'll run away\]. I felt like
my grandfather was not talking about a person, instead he was talking
about some domestic animal, which always should be kept in chains.

Bhola was never respected. He was always at the recieving end of
scolding. I have always seen him busy in some kind of hard work. He was
always presented with some work even if that work was useless. He used
to redo things too many times just because there was a change in my
grandfather's mood.

I never saw Bhola angry. He was always polite, always looking at his
feet while talking to anybody (even to me although I was very much
younger than him).

My grandfather is no more now and Bhola is a rich man who lives in Bihar
with his family couting his last days. I just wish that this kind of
work culture should have gone along with my grandfather.

The caricature which I am posting this time is that of 'Lal-tain baba'.
He was a special character in the play which we played once in our
college. It was an instant hit. I still feel proud that I was a major
part of that play. Lal-tain baba, played by [Sushant
Kaul](http://www.blogger.com/profile/13999128732009276214) was an
interlude, but I still remember that people were laughing most when he
was on stage. The great entertainer. God bless him!
