So Kallu and Gappu meet again. Kallu is going to be married and is in his courtship period while Gappu as always
is his best friend.

**Kallu**: Man! my marriage is not going to work...

**Gappu**: Damn! That was a very immense statement. What happened
bro!

**Kallu**: It was my birthday yesterday...


**Gappu**: It was your birthday yesterday???

**Kallu**: Yeah! It was...and like always you forgot it my BEST FRIEND!!!

**Gappu**: Oh! Happy Birthday Man! Where’s my party?

**Kallu** gives Gappu a look. Normally guys
don’t understand looks. But this one was very much clear to Gappu. It
said something like, “One more word and you are a dead man.”

**Gappu**: Ok, so what happened with Meenu?
Did you saw some very hot chick on your birthday who was ready to go
down on the very first night and now you are having second thoughts
about your marriage?

**Kallu**: No ass! It’s nothing like that. I’m an honest man and I love Meenu a lot!

**Gappu**: Bah! Love ! Ha Ha... anyways, what’s the scoop here?

**Kallu**: Meenu spent whole day with me and
night too, I was forbidden to meet any of my friends on that day, not
even you. My cell phone was off and all she gifted me was a big teddy
bear and 2 black chocolates

**Gappu** (with surprised look): She was with you the whole night?

**Kallu**: Shut Up Gappu! You are not listening.

**Gappu**: Oh Ok! So what’s the deal! She gifted you something.

**Kallu**: A TEDDY-BEAR and some fuckin’ chocolate!

**Gappu**: yeah.. YEAH??? What??? She gifted you girly gifts?

**Kallu**: Yes! Even on MY birthday, she was pleasing herself.

**Gappu**: That means you were not able to make it throughout the night?

**Kallu**: What difference it makes? She’s my fiancée and we are going to make it soon... after marriage.

**Gappu**: ...which you think is not going to work, because she gifted you some damn soft-toy...huh?

**Kallu**: Man! She claims that she cares for me, but the truth is she cares only for her. She only wants me to
care for her, to leave everything else and placate her. I’m done with
it, I have a life to live.

**Gappu**: Hmmm! What are you thinking of presenting her, on your ‘*suhaag-raat*’ \[wedding night\]

**Kallu**: You present some gift on ‘suhaag-raat’ also?? What for?

**Gappu**: It’s known as ‘*muh-dikhayi*’. You have to do it before removing her ‘*ghunghat*’. Otherwise you are
not going to have 'that'.

**Kallu**: Oh really!!! Damn these customs. Hmm... lemme think of a gift. What about a camera? It will be useful, throughout life.

**Gappu**: Don’t you think it’s ‘a guy thing.

**Kallu**: ya! But I’ll capture her images too in that camera. Our memories .. .you know!

**Gappu**: See! This is human. We all try to gift to our loved ones what we want to get. It’s a human way of telling your loved ones that this is what would make you happy. For example, if a girl is showing you care she wants you to care for her more.

**Kallu**: Care for her all of the time!!! 24 X 7 what am I? Her Mama?

**Gappu**: Ya! Girls are a bit crazy

**Kallu**: Yes Girls ARE CRAZY!!!

**Gappu**: ...but that’s what makes them interesting subject. That’s why we like them. What say?

**Kallu**: (giggling) yeah! Love ‘em.... Oops! ‘Her’.

**Gappu**: So you gonna marry 'her'?

**Kallu**: Damn yes man! what do you think? I was just fed up.

**Gappu**: So you are ready to spend your whole life with her, even if she doesn't make 'that' with you through out your life?

**Kallu**: That's not gonna happen...

**Gappu**: How can you be sure? She didn't make it on the night of your birthday... Your night.. you know.

**Kallu**: Shut Up Gappu!

**Gappu**: OK! you 'love' her. :)... for sure.

In this sketch I did another attempt to
figure out a girl. This time a more serious sketch but definitely not a
best shot.
