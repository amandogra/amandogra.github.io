Two girls, really fat girls, were sitting across in the
auto-rickshaw lately. They saw a girl with well maintained figure across
the road. One said,"Too skinny". Other said,"Yeah".

First One said,"My
doctor says that I am having exact weight and shape what a girl of my
age should have." She was a college going girl and mind it she was
overweight, too much overweight. Other one chimed in like,"Of course you
are. I yesterday had my weight done and I am just 50Kgs." Blow me down!
that girl was nothing less than 80 Kgs. Ok I exaggerated; she was about
70 Kgs. Then they looked at me and said in unison,"So what if we've some
baby-fat, we are cute".

Then a thought came to my mind. We all keep lying to hide our
incapability or our weaknesses. We 'ALL' do it. Either by getting
defensive or by getting aggressive, by doing self-pity or by
self-importance, we all display a dishonest attitude towards our
own-selves.

I find it difficult to sketch girls. One of the beautiful creations by
the almighty. But in this piece of mine, I have tried to create a girl
cartoon. Hope you people like it. Do let me know your views.
