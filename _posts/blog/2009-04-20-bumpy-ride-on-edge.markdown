One more Monday... Normally it's impossible to enter a blog entry on
a Monday, as Mondays are the busiest of the days, but somehow I have got
time today. I wanted to say 'Luckily I got time...', but the thing is
that, in these days of recession having free time in office is a quite
dangerous thing. If you are blogging and that too from the office then
that means your job is definitely in jeopardy. But then, this is life in
a cartoon's way... 'A Bumpy Ride On The Edge'.
<!--more-->

A number of confusions, needs and compromises are going on but again this is life and I guess these 'things' are never going to seize, they will keep on coming, with
different looks and different sizes.

What would you do, if you have got a complex mathematical equation to
solve and you don't know the exact formula to solve it?

1.  Keep on doing hit and trail to create your own formula
2.  Look towards your nearby sheet for help
3.  Leave the question and go out to have some air
4.  Leave the question and start whining (or crying)

This question has nothing to do with Mathematics. This is a question
which life presents us with everyday, every moment. None of the options
above is wrong, it's just that, whatever option we choose, defines our
nature, our behavior, our ideas about living, or our... Attitude. Try to
keep it positive. Have Luck!

The item which I have brought out of my carton today is again 'Hanuman'
ji in some angry mood. I like drawing Bajrangbali because, He gives me
too many options to explore. You can draw a great physique, can play
with the hair, can put some comic-put with the tail, you don't have to
care much about face and above all, you get the blessings of the Lord.
So go ahead and try it youself... Jai Bajrangbali :)
