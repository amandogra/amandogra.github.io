It's been quite a while since I have added any entry to my blog... A
lot happened during this period which kept me busy. My bro got hit
\[no.. no.. he's not a celebrity\]. He just met an accident on 20th last
month. I know he is a rash driver, but cursing him is not going to do
any good to him or us. So lets cut the crap, he is now on bed with two
screws in his left leg. Recovering fast... he's the man! <!--more-->

I also went to Salasar, Rajasthan to pay my obeisances to 'balaji' and had my head shaved too ;) \[don't give me a look like I have put shit on my head\].

Recession has affected the whole world. Sometimes I doubt that, is there
really some slump going on or is it some kind of strategy which our so
called 'bosses' have invented to fill in their pockets instead of ours?
Anyways this tragedy hit some of my chimps too :( There was a lots of
politics, conspiracies, gossips, bitching and back-biting while all this
laying off was going on and I was sincerly involved in all that. Ha!
These all things have kept me busy lately.

I drew this while traveling to Salasar. I figured out that it's
difficult to draw in a moving car. I 'll never try that again :P This
time scanner didn't work as it used to and I used a different image
editing software to clear the image. In conclusion, I messed this image
up... but I wanted to share it, so enjoy and shoot me with your critics
:) Jai Bajrang bali! God Bless you All!
