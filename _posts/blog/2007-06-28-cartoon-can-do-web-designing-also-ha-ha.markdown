The Sunflower Design is the oldest of all these three and I like it most. It
took a lots of time. I was at the basic level of CSS at that time. Alot
has chaged since then :)

This is a proposed design for 'Insignia of Eminence', our still on dreams
company :)

This was the old design for the iEminence , short for 'Insignia of
Eminence' yet registered. Actually both these names are our trademarks
(again in dreams) so don't try to copy them otherwise I can sue you :)
The journey doesn't end here, I have a lots of designs and as soon I'll
get time again I'll put them on the web. Keep looking up ... Enjoy!
