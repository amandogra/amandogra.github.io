Today, I was looking for a digital painting course which is not as
expensive as they normally are. I stumbled through many speed painting
videos on YouTube but nothing else excited me until I found this guy's
blog http://lifehacker.com/5778700/digital-painting-101-getting-started.
I have already covered three videos. This guys uses nice techniques. The
video quality is good and above all it is free :)
