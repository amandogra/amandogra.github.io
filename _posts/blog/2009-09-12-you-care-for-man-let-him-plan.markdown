So it all happened a few days ago, when a friend of mine came to meet me
after a very long time. We were together for about one and a half hours.
Through out the time, either she was talking over the phone or she was
text-ing messages on the phone, we even said our goodbyes while she was
talking over phone. I didn't show her, but honestly it pissed me off.

And I was not the only person who was getting irritated, the person on
the other side of the phone would also be in the same agony. Actually
she was insisting her boy-friend (person on other side of phone) to come
to Noida from Shahdra(Delhi) at about 8 PM, just to pick her to Dhaula
Kuan, the other end of Delhi.

When she told me this, I was like 'What the F?" I said," You want a person to cross the traffic of Delhi at the peak hour, just to be your driver? Plus he is not nearby, he would be coming from about 20 KM, then he'll take you to some place which is
about 2 hours run from here wihtout traffice jams. When would 'he' reach
back his home?"

But it was none of her concern, she said calmy,"This is love. If he
loves me, he'll do that. Atleast we'll meet."

Girls! take my advice. Being a guy I can tell you, this is one of the
most torturous thing a girl can do to a guy. Testing his love by these
filthy means. Think rational. How can you expect a person, who has
attended the office throughout the day, to travel for about 5 hours just
to meet you. Plus what do you expect this meeting would be like? It
would be full of fighting and irritation, a blame-game. Then you girls
say you 'care'. If this is care, then I would like to be harsh to say
that you girls only care to call, to text, to talk, to meet, to cuddle,
to carress, to tease, to satisfy your libido, to test his patience and to
test his love. You don't care about 'him'.

If you girls claim that you care, then let him plan. Don't try to
control him, just be controlled and he'll be controlled by you :) Ya! I
know it sounds very complex. But so are relationships. I read somewhere
that in a relationship, just 'Have a heart'. To take this advice, just
'Have a big heart' and let him do what he wants to and pretty soon he'll
be doing what you have always wanted... and that also for life. Trust me
on that!

One more thing, I know women are multi-tasking, but please keep your
this skill aside when you have come to meet a guy. Better if you
remember this next time :)

I created this picture of Radha and Shyam, a long time ago, but as I was
ill yesterday and had a lot of time, I filled in some pencil colors and
am presenting now, first colorful sketch out of my carton. Hare Krishna!
