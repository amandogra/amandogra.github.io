Pooh got married. No! I am not hurt due to that, on the contrary, I am happy for her. She and Mohit were a looking very good as a couple. I was in Patiala for the same occasion which incredibly was on Valentine's Day. I’ve never given much of an importance to this day (I mean Valentine's Day). I don’t know what is the need of this day in India, but I am not against it either. Instead I hate those who are opposing it or creating nuisance on this day by creating violence in the name of culture.

<!--more-->

The culture of the country which I know as India, as my country, is peaceful and
accepting. We as Indians have accepted the cultures from all over the
world, though with some modifications according to our own, but we
have... accepted. Acceptance is our culture. Free thinking is our
culture. We believe in ‘live and let live’.

For last few weeks, I was thinking through my heart. I don’t know why
and how the sentimental guy inside me was on rage. That sentimental guy
inside me instigated me to do things which I would have never done in my
own self. Blame it on the love songs or the pheromones or the sketch
which I have got on my wall, I was thinking of love whereas the truth
is... there is nothing like love, it’s only lust. I guess once more I
have touched the controversial topic of Love vs Lust. I am not so good
at this love thing, so I think I should leave this topic. It can only
hurt and it's not the first time that I am hurt. Also, I am sure that
it's not the last. As Def Leppard says, "I'll love again" \[may be the
same girl ;)\]. Enough of this love-bullshit, 'the Cartoon' can not think or love. It's heinous crime in my world.

Now lets get down to business. The sketch which I have pulled out of my
carton today was tooned by me when I was teaching in [CEC,
Landran](http://www.cecmohali.org/) \[Yeah! Yeah! I can teach too
Ha!\]

I guess you have also seen this kind of scenes while you were in college
;)
