I tried my hands on [Inkspace](http://inkscape.org/index.php?lang=en).

It's an open source vector image manipulation software. There are number
of step by step tutorials over [there](http://inkscapetutorials.wordpress.com/).

I have followed one of these [tutorial](http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/icon-design/use-inkscape-to-create-a-grunge-rss-box-icon/)s and came up with the logo for my blog. Hope you like it!
