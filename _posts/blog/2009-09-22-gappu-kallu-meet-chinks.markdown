Ok! so you guys like them in [EPISODE ONE]({% post_url 2009-08-31-gappu-aur-kallu-ki-mulakat-episode-one %}). Well! first of all a lot of thanks for your lovely comments. Gappu and
Kallu also have a friend named 'Chinks'. She is not as happening as her
friends are but still a character is a character. So let me present to
you...EPISODE TWO
<!--more-->

\[Chinks is sitting on a bench in park. Her head hanging down. She has
headphones of her iPod in her ears. Gappu and Kallu come to her\]

**Gappu**: Hey Sweets! why are you looking like someone has hung a
watermelon to your neck?

**Chinks**: sigh!!

**Kallu**: What happened Chinks? Why are you sighing?

**Chinks**: Please leave me alone...

**Gappu**: I guess she had a fight with her boy-friend again

**Chinks**: \[shouting\] I haven't talked to him since ages

**Kallu**: And how many days are there in those ages?

**Chinks**: \[sadly\] five months

**Gappu**: Five months??? Gimme a break gal! are you still sad for the same
guy. Come On! forget him! five months is a big time

**Kallu**: Hey! don't be so rude... but Chinks he has got a point... you
should move on

**Chinks**: No! I have tried everything to forget him... but I just can't

**Gappu**: Hey! I reckon I should bring my videocam she is about to cry Ha!
Ha!

**Kallu**: Shutup! Gappu

\[Kallu sits besides Chinks and pull off her headphones\]
**Chinks**! first of all stop listening to the songs which you have sung or
heard together or dedicated to each other. Any song which reminds of
him

**Chinks**: All the songs remind of him

**Gappu**: Come On babe! your iPod needs a break. Even it's bored by your
songs. You need a new playlist. Fill your jukebox with 'I'll survive' by
'Gloria Gayno' or 'Party like a rockstar' by 'Shop Boyz'. Start
listening to hip-hop or dance numbers

**Kallu**: Yes! Change your playlist... stop listening to what reminds of
him

**Chinks**: ...but he is everywhere. All the faces seem like him

**Gappu**: because you are finding him. Still searching for him... Still
hoping that he'll come around and say 'hey baby! wanna mingle?'

**Kallu**: Mind it! he's not coming back

**Chinks**: No! I don't want to hear it. If I had one more chance. If I
could talk to him one 'last' time. I would do anything to have him back

**Kallu**: There is nothing like 'last conversation'. You can just start it
all over again...

**Chinks**: yes! I want to start it all over again... I want to erase all
the mistakes... I just want to hold him one last time...

**Gappu**: ... timeout! there is no back-gear. If, by any darn chance he
comes back... then you both are going to repeat the same mistakes and
after few months we'll again be having similar kind of discussion.
Accept it hon! it's over

**Chinks**: No! I saw him. he was sitting alone and very sad in his class

**Kallu**: Are you spying on him? still... He could be sad for any damn
reason or may be he was not , he seemed sad to you becuase you wanted to
see this. It's about six months honey...

**Chinks**:...no 'five'...

**Gappu**: ...whatever... if you could have done something about it, you
already would have

**Kallu**: Yes dear! Gappu's harsh but right. You are running behind
shadows. There is no happiness there. Forget him... move on!

**Chinks**: It's easy for you to say... but I'm the one who is in pain.
Anywhere I go, I find myself sitting besides him, I find myself talking
to him, conversating with myself when no one is around, even now I can
feel him sitting besides me on this very bench where we sat when we
dated for the third time and then it occurs to me, that he.. is...
gone... he left me... It's like... one of my body part has been ripped
off...

\[and then 'it' happened, what Kallu was afraid of. Gappu missed his
videocam. Chinks started crying\]
**Kallu**: Chinks! this is the time to make memories... not to endure them.
There will be a time in your life when you'll laugh at these moments

**Gappu**: Yes! come out... make new memories in the same places. Throw some
bashing parties in all those places where you still see him

**Kallu**: Yeah! like from now on... remember this is the bench where you
thought about him for the last time. Spend more quality time with your
parents, with your siblings

**Gappu**:...with us... your friends

**Kallu**: Yeah! go spendin'! buy too many gifts for everyone and anyone.
Try to be funny

**Chinks**: I'm not funny. Actually I am not happy even

**Gappu**: ...then pretend. You know once a priest had a chance to meet the
Pope. He asked,"Father! I m loosing faith in lord. How could I tell
other people to have faith when I am not having it myself". You know
what Pope said? He said,"Fake it"

**Kallu**: Yes! if you are not brave, pretend it... no body can tell the
difference

**Gappu**: Try to solve other people's proplems. Be a 'love guru'... now
that you are hurt in love, you got more experience and more in-depth
knowledge about so called 'love'. Use it for better good

**Chinks**: Whenever I see a couple I feel more alone

**Kallu**: Next time smile at them and wish them luck. Believe me they are
gonna need it :) as... everybody is having a complicated relationship...
those who are with somebody want to feel the freedom.. and those who are
without somebody want to be tied

**Gappu**: You know one always have power to put the weight down, no matter
how much heavy it is. Life has a purpose and if you are not doing
something about your purpose, you are wasting time.

**Kallu**: Recently I had a chat with an old friend, he told me that he has
broken his guitar, because it used to remind him of her. I don't suggest
you to do something that aggressive, it was his way of moving on, but if
it helps then go for it.

**Gappu**: Yes! don't try to find what he is doing. just think he is happy
and boozing hard with his friends...

**Chinks**: How could he be happy when I am sad

**Gappu**: Helloo! you are not connected now... Ok... you never were... He
is a free animal now... He is happy or whatever you just don't care..
you just should not care. If he is not with you, then he's just not
worth it. It's only your libido which is raging. World is full of guys
honey! the boy-girl sex ratio is 10 isto 7

**Chinks**: \[angrily\] What are you suggesting, should I go and hit on
every guy I find on my way?

**Gappu**: Why not?

**Kallu**: No! Chinks! what he is suggesting is that you have to keep
sending a message to your head that you are more free and happy. Just
open yourself and be ready to accept whatever life is going to gift you.
Trust me you got a lot in your kitty, you are just ignoring it

**Gappu**: yeah! you could concentrate on your career

**Chinks**: I don't feel like doing anything

**Kallu**: Stop scratching your wounds... give them time to get healed

**Gappu**: Yeah! someone told me once...'no pain can last forever'. Time is
a big healer. You can also try joining some Yoga classes or any kind of
other spiritual hoolah for the moolah. It helps... I can bet on that

**Kallu**: Point is... just get envolved in anything and everything ... Life
is short, don't waste it dear on something which is not worth it... Move
On! Delete his number from all of your contact lists. Don't text him,
don't email him, don't call him.

**Gappu**: No! No! call him one last time and abuse him, as bad as you can
or want to

**Kallu**: I won't suggest that

**Gappu**: Like anything else, bad days are also temporary. You've already
wasted six months...

**Chinks**: ...Five...

**Gappu**: ...yeah! whatever, in this time you could have lost 1o kilos

**Chinks**: What??? Do I look fat?

**Gappu**: Not a bit chick! what are you doing tonight?

**Chinks** and Kallu simultaneously: SHUT UP!

He! he! I hope you liked the episode two too. Anyways, if you are in the
corporate world, then atleast you are definitely going to like the
cartoon which I have brought out this time out of my carton. Job culture
is disgusting everywhere. I sometimes think that this department known
as 'Management' is an overhead. But as Gappu and Kallu told Chinks, if
you are fed up of a job (or are frustrated by a relation which didn't
work out)... shoot it out... just remember to give it your best shot...
once you are conviced that you have honestly done whatever you could to
save it... then its the time to come out... to move on
