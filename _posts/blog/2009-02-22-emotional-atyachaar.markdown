I saw 'Dev D' last Saturday. The movie was all about 'I am slut'. Everyone in the movie got screwed ultimately. I liked the movie. I liked the way the real nature of the boy-girl relationships was displayed in the movie.

<!--more-->

Paro was 'hot'. I loved it when she said, 'Mein pagal ho rahi
hoon' over the phone. First over the phone, then in Dev's room, then near the
*gusalkhana*, then the boldest and \[the best ;)\] scene *ganne ke khet mein* \[in sugarcane fields\], it was all about S. E. X. and I was sitting in the middle of two girls. lucky me! or unlucky me!

I am still confused whether she (Paro) had really done 'it' with her *naukar* \[Sunil\] or not. Then there was Chanda. A sweet but spoiled child. A divine prostitute, sex worker, escort or like she said *randi*. I liked her role. And 'Dev'... phew! he was the biggest of the sluts, who screwed himself over and over again.

I also liked the way the story writer has changed the ending from that of the conventional 'Devdas' \[Don't ask me how... go watch movie\]. Moral of the story: Indian Cinema is getting bolder and we have started talking about sex as another activity Ha! strange. \[I wonder what my parents have to say about it ;) :P\]\

I also read ‘Of course I love you!... till I find someone better’. Once
someone told me to read ‘P.S. I love you’ but I know that would be
painful for me, so I ended up reading a book with almost the same name.
Kiddin! ;) I just got this book from Manveen accidentally. For the first
100 pages, the book was awful. I was cursing myself, why I started
reading this. The book was full of mindless affairs, girls, kisses and
sex, but then a breakup happened in the middle of the book and the other
half of the book suddenly became awesome. The main character of the book
was in agony, real agony.

I sometimes think that it's always other’s agony which gives us pleasure. More the other person is in pain, more happy we are. Or may be the Newton’s law of energy applies to happiness also. ‘The happiness is constant. It can never be created nor be destroyed; It can only be transferred from one person to another or transformed from one form to another. Whatever, but I believe that you can spread happiness even in the most painful days of yours. Like ‘Deb’ in the book did for ‘Amit’ and ‘Astha’ \[I liked that part a lot\] or like I am doing by showing you this:

This item which I have posted today, reminds me of the days (rather
nights) which we have spent copying and pasting the assignments and
completing just a lecture before or sometimes after the due dates. Most
of the engineers are dextrous at this at least ;)
