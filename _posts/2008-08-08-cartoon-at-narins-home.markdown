It has really been long since I have done any blog entry. Everybody
today is blogging. Even Bollywood Superstarts have started using these
blogs to abuse their co-starts. It' a good and easy way to gain
popularity. Who am I? I am nobody compared to these superstars. I am
just another regular guy, trying to create space for myself.

Today, I am in Jalandhar. Goraya exactly \[like you care!\]. I am here
with my friend and roommate for last seven years Narin Kalra. I am doing
this blog entry through his home. The last time I did any sketching
was... I don' t remember. No Sketch, so no blog. I have gone so much
busy with my office life that I am forgetting everything, but then all
of us have become busy. I miss those times when people were excited to
see my sketches. When they were pouring in ideas and waiting patiently
to let me finish up. Those days are gone with the time and we have gone
busy like anything. But somehow today, I brought these few minutes to
enter this blog entry. I have taken a day off on Monday, just to relax.
I guess we'll be going to '[Rangla
Punjab](http://www.haveliheritage.co.in/rangla-punjab-photo.htm)'
tonight and am planning to go to home for a weekend near our
Independance Day.

While I am here, I have helped Narin to earn some reputation in front of his
parents by creating a static site for his father's confectionary
business. Attaching a snapshot. Nothing more this time...
