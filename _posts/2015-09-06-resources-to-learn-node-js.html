<p>In this post I am going to share few resources which I find as helpful for learning NodeJS.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Recently I have stumbled on a very good website to learn nodeJS interactively. <a href="http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers" target="_blank">http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers</a></p>
<p><a href="https://amandogra.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-05-at-11-50-25-pm.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-152" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2015-09-05-at-11-50-25-pm.png?w=300" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-05 at 11.50.25 PM" width="300" height="217" /></a></p>
<p>I reached this tutorial from a book by Azat Mardan named "<a href="https://leanpub.com/jsfun" target="_blank">JavaScript and Node FUNdamentals</a>"  Also, there is this great guy named Amit Rajan who explains nodeJS with examples. <a href="http://amirrajan.net/nodejs-by-example/" target="_blank">http://amirrajan.net/nodejs-by-example/</a> In his own words,</p>
<blockquote><p>I prefer not to write blog post showing coding samples. They tend to go stale and lose relevance quickly. Instead, I publish sample apps to GitHub with pretty damn good documentation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Subscribe to weekly newsletter on NodeJS at <a href="http://nodeweekly.com/" target="_blank">http://nodeweekly.com/</a>. This is quite helpful.</p>
<p>So, enjoy these while I find more relevant resources related to nodeJS.</p>
