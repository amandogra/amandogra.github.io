Life can be lived in two ways -<br /><ol><li><span style="font-style: italic;">"Sab kucch theek ho jayega"</span> means that "Everything will be alright"</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">"Sab kucch theek hai"</span> means that"Everything is alright</li></ol>Either we can spend our lives waiting for a new dawn which will come through the darkest hours of our nights and spread up as happiness into our lives or we can keep on living like nothing bad is going on and all we have is now. All the happiness is now. There is nothing like a happiness which is to be found in the future.<br /><br />Both these sentences are complete in themselves and in a sense both are incomplete. We can go on living with hopes for a better tomorrow or we can go on living with no awareness about tomorrow.<br /><br />I think we should leave all those philosophical talks for now and concentrate on the item from the carton of the cartoon.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_s5GVahsJtq0/SYvflrRLDnI/AAAAAAAAA6M/shX9uuCxiE8/s1600-h/100_0072.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_s5GVahsJtq0/SYvflrRLDnI/AAAAAAAAA6M/shX9uuCxiE8/s320/100_0072.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5299575224894426738" border="0" /></a>This picture is of my own kitchen garden in the backyard of my home. It was the sunlight which attracted me. A sunny morning in the winters is nothing but a precious gift.
