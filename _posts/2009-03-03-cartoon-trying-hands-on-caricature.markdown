Caricature (pronounced as CARE-ick-ture) is a [portrait](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait "Portrait") that
exaggerates or distorts the essence of a person or thing to create an
easily identifiable visual likeness, or in literature, a description of
a person using exaggeration of some characteristics and
oversimplification of others.

Recently I bumped into this cool [website](http://www.tomrichmond.com/caricatures.php) which was full of caricatures. I'm still drooling over it. I have always been a fan of
cartoonists or specifically caricaturists since my childhood. I remember
names like Shekhar Gurera, SaranDeep, Lata, R K Laxman, Ninan and many
more which I have seen and waited for on the Newspapers and Magazines. I
have loved their creations and was always impressed. So now I myself
tried my hands on this form of art. Do tell me should I try more or do I
really suck on this.

The subject which I have taken into account is our Sys-Ops guy. There is
a word famous about him in our office. Whenever Sanjeev is on your seat,
your machine is really in 'Danger'. Ha! There is a very funny line
related to Windows. "If the problem is small... Restart, and if it is
big... Reinstall". I guess Sanjeev follows this too well ;) no offence.
