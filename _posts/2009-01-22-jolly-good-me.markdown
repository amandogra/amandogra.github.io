We do too many things, rather we spend our lives to be 'happy', but
deep down we all know that it is a never ending quest. A war which we
are never going to win. A pursuit which is never going to finish.

Why I am talking so pessimistically? Because I am not happy :).I am
NOT in my jolly-good nature. But I know that this will pass like any
other phase of my life. The life goes on after-all. It's just a matter
of days or may be hours if I am strong enough. May the almighty bless me
with power to bear the pain which I have beget myself. Life is nothing,
but a set of choices. We make it and then we regret.

By the way the item which I have brought out of my carton today is a
picture of a direction-post near to my birth-place.
