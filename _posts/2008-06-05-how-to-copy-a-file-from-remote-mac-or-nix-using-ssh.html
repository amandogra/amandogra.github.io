<p>&gt;There are times when you are working on a remote linux or mac machine and you have to copy a file to your own *nix or mac machine. So, Tarun told me a way for that today. I am going to explain this with the help of an example. I am assuming that both the remote and the local machine are using mac OS</p>
<p>Suppose the IP of remote mac machine is 192.168.1.1 and the IP of your local machine is 192.168.1.2. The directory which you want to copy is located at /Users/remote/copyMe/ and the location where you want to place it on your machine is /Users/local/placeHere/ [sidenote: to find the IP of your machine. Run the Terminal and type <span style="font-family:courier new;">ifconfig</span>]</p>
<p>Now Open the Terminal on your local machine and type:<br />ssh [remote_ip_address] -l [remote_user_name]</p>
<p>i.e. <span style="font-family:courier new;">ssh 192.168.1.1 -l root</span></p>
<p>Note here that it is small L (not one) switch after the remote address and that the remote_user_name is the username to access the remote machine</p>
<p>With this command you'll be asked for the login password. Once the correct password is filled you will be able to enter the remote machine. Now is the time to copy the directory [or just a file] from this remote machine to your local machine. This can be done in a single command. Like this:<br />scp -r [path to the source] [local_user_name]@[local_ip_address]:[path to the destination]<br />Now let me make it non-generic</p>
<p><span style="font-family:courier new;">scp -r /Users/remote/copyMe/ aman@192.168.1.2:/Users/local/placeHere/</span></p>
<p>Now all the contents of the remote directory 'copyMe', will be placed under 'placeHere' local directory. I have used a -r here to copy the directory recursively. if you are copying only a file then there is no need for this switch.</p>
<p>So was that so difficult! ;)
