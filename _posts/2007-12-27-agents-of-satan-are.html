I am not getting much time these days. Busy and packed. Today I brought out some more of my creations from my carton. These two characters came into being when I was a lecturer and trying hard to learn Macromedia Flash. I created these on paper and then on PC without scanning [as at that time I didn't get my hands on any scanner. Moreover I didn't know how to trace in Flash] Anyways, presenting in front of you the 'Agents of Satan'. I haven't named them yet. Suggestions are welcome
