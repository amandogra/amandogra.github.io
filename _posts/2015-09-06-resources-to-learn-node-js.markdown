I reached this tutorial from a book by Azat Mardan named "[JavaScript
and Node FUNdamentals](https://leanpub.com/jsfun)"  Also, there is this
great guy named Amit Rajan who explains nodeJS with
examples. <http://amirrajan.net/nodejs-by-example/> In his own words,

Subscribe to weekly newsletter on NodeJS at <http://nodeweekly.com/>.
