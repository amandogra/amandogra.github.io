<p>In this post we are going to setup a working MEAN stack application on a Digital Ocean virtual server from stratch.</p>

<div id="wmd-preview-section-880" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="digital-ocean-account">Digital Ocean account</h2>
<p>First step first, go to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> and sign up.</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-881" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="create-a-droplet">Create a droplet</h2>
<p>Once you have created your account on Digital Ocean, go ahead and click on ‘Create Droplet’ button on the top of the page.</p>
<p>You’ll be presented with different pricing options. Choose the ‘size’ as per your requirements. I chose the first (least expensive) one. You could upgrade anytime so feel free to choose anyone.</p>
<p>Under the “Select Region”, select a region which is near to your target audience or you.</p>
<p>Under the “Select Image” section, there is a tab named “Distribution”. Choose ‘Ubunut’ (latest version) here and from the ‘Applications’ tab choose “Mean on ”</p>
<p>Fill in the billing information and you are presented with a new machine of yours own.</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-882" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="access-console">Access Console</h2>
<p>Now that you have a virtual machine setup, you should access it. So from the top menu click on ‘Droplets’ and you’ll be presented with the list of your droplets.</p>
<p>Click on the name of the droplet you just created.</p>
<p>On the next page, click on ‘Reset password’. You’ll get an email with a temporary password.</p>
<p>On the page where you clicked on ‘Reset passowrd’, there is another button names ‘Console Access’. Click on that and you’ll land on a terminal. This is the face of your droplet.</p>
<p>Login as ‘root’ using the password you got in the email. Reset the password as soon as you login. The system will ask you to do it automatically.</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-883" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="verifyinstall-mean">Verify/Install MEAN</h2>
<p>After login, try to run the following command:</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-884" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs livecodeserver"> npm -<span class="hljs-built_in">version</span></code></pre>
<p>If it returns with a proper version of NPM then that means that node is installed already. You remember we chose MEAN in the applications tab while creating droplet.</p>
<p>I have observed that MongoDB is not install by default. I might be wrong but I used the following tutorial to install the MongoDB on Ubuntu14.04</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-14-04">How to install MongoDB on Ubuntu 14.04</a></p>

<div id="wmd-preview-section-885" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="install-tmux-optional">Install tmux (Optional)</h2>
<p>Personally, for me, working on a single terminal was a bit difficult, so I installed tmux on my droplet.</p>
<p>To do so, type the following command:</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-886" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs bash"> <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> apt-get install tmux</code></pre>
<p>Once the tmux is installed take a crash course on tmux <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course">here</a></p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-887" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="clone-your-project">Clone your project</h2>
<p>Now that our machine is set, we should concentrate on our project. Download your project from github. If your project is not on github, I would strongly advice you to do so. If you can not or don’t want to, then you could SSH to your machine and copy the code through that to your droplet.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to setup ssh, then while cloning the project from the github pass the https url.</p>
</div>
<div id="wmd-preview-section-976" class="wmd-preview-section preview-content">
<h2 id="process-management">Process Management</h2>
<p>Install <a href="http://pm2.keymetrics.io/">PM2</a> and run your server using this process manager. PM2 is a process manager which gives you a lot of options.</p>
<p>You are all set. Check your application online using the IP Address provided at the bottom of the console access page.</p>
