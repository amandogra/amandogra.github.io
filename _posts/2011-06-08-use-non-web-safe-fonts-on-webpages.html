<p>Have you ever thought of using a special font on your webpage and then ended up using some boring web-safe font or an image instead just because the font was not web-safe? Well, now the designers don't have to compromise as now we have techniques which can be used to load the specific font you want on your webpage.</p>
<p>A beautiful font is also as much a part of beautiful design as the good images are. Before the entry of HTML5, web-designers were using only web-safe fonts. What are web-safe fonts? Why only web-safe fonts are used for web platform? The websites are viewed on different platforms. Different fonts are installed on different platforms. All types of fonts are not installed on a single machine. For example, a Mac machine does NOT has 'Trebuchet MS' whereas the Windows machine does not has 'Apple Garamond' font on it. So, the web-safe fonts are those fonts which are available on all or most of the platforms, like 'Arial' or 'Verdana'. Creating websites using web-safe fonts is a good practice as the text on your website will be displayed similar on all the platforms.</p>
<p>But at times using web-safe font is not stylish. There might be times when you have craved to use that special font in your header and end up using some boring font or an image instead. Well, now we don't have to compromise as now we have techniques which can be used to load the specific font you want on your webpage. There are many techniques like <a title="cufon" href="http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/" target="_blank">cufon</a>, <a title="siFR" href="http://www.sifrgenerator.com/" target="_blank">siFR</a> , <a href="http://typekit.com" target="_blank">type-kit</a> to solve this issue. But all these methods have different issues, like in 'cufon' you can not select the text, 'siFR' uses Flash to embed the font into the webpages and 'type-kit' is not completely free. The method which I am going to discuss today is a bit different from these techniques as it is simple CSS. It's known as <strong>@font-face</strong> method.</p>
<p><strong>Choose the font</strong></p>
<p>Enough talk, now let's see how to use @font-face method. First of all choose the font you want to use. Some good resources to choose a font are as below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dafont.com/">http://www.dafont.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://fontdeck.com/">http://fontdeck.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">http://www.fontsquirrel.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Generate a web-font-kit</strong></p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the font, open <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator">http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator</a> and add the font to the @font-face Kit Generator</p>
<p><a href="http://www.survah.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/font-gen1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-156" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/font-gen1.png" alt="" width="617" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>Once you choose a font from the 'Add font' dialog box, it will start generating he web-font-kit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.survah.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/font-gen2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-157" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/font-gen2.png" alt="" width="616" height="359" /></a></p>
<p>Once the @web-font-kit is ready for download, the Choose 'Optimal' if you do not know much about font optimization. Check the checkbox and click on 'Download You Kit'</p>
<p><strong>Keep the fonts at appropriate location</strong></p>
<p>Extract the contents of the webfontkit-xxxx.zip file which is downloaded as kit. You'll observe that there are several files starting with the name of the font. These files contain the font in different formats like .eot, .svg, .ttf, .woff . All these the necessary as different platforms understand different formats of font.</p>
<p>Copy these four files to a location in your server. For the purpose of this tutorial I have placed these files in the same location where the css file is.</p>
<p><strong>Adding the @font-face rule in CSS</strong></p>
<p>Now that our fonts are at right location, lets add the rule which is going to do the magic. In your CSS file, add a code (as above as possible) as follows:</p>
<p>{code type=css}<br />
@font-face {<br />
font-family: 'nameOfYourFont';<br />
src: url('nameofyourfont-webfont.eot');<br />
src: url('nameofyourfont-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),<br />
url('nameofyourfont-webfont.woff') format('woff'),<br />
url('nameofyourfont-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),<br />
url('nameofyourfont-webfont.svg#BebasNeueRegular') format('svg');<br />
font-weight: normal;<br />
font-style: normal;<br />
{/code}</p>
<p>In this code the url() will point to the paths of the fonts copied in the last step and 'nameOfYourFont' will be replaced by the name of the font you generated (It could be anything except the names of default web fonts). An easy way of doing it is to copy the content of the style.css file which is found in the folder which was extracted in the last step.<br />
Syntax is sefl-explanatory. We are creating a new font-family by loading the font from a specific location on server. We can now simply use this font-family in our CSS anywhere. For example,<br />
{code type=css}<br />
p { font-family: nameOfYourFont, Arial, san-serif; font-size: 12px}<br />
{/code}<br />
Now all the &lt;p&gt; elements on the webpage will be displayed in the new font. You can use as many @font-face definitions as you require. This blog is also using a @font-face for the main navigation. You may check that in the CSS file.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Creating a web font-family is not difficult now. Just convert the selected font into different formats. Place them on your server. Define a @font-face and use the font like any other font family. I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and now you'll be using beautiful fonts in any webpage you like.<br />
Happy coding!</p>
