<p>&gt;I spent a few hours on the book 'Software Engineering - A Practitioner's guide' by Roger S. Pressman. i was reading the chapter 'Testing Strategies', when I found some really interesting facts related to Validation and Verification. There is a strong divergence of opinion about what is 'validation' testing. Some people say that all testing is verification and the validation is conducted when the requirements are reviewed and approved, and when the system is operational, then user validates it. Other people believe that the unit and integration testing is verification and higher-order testing is validation. So overall-<br />Verication is <span style="font-style:italic;">Are we building the product Right?</span><br />Validation is <span style="font-style:italic;">Are we building the right product?</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The first mistake that people make is thinking that the testing team is responsible for assuring quality</p></blockquote>
