Once more I encountered this piece of article... "India in 1835". I am
proud that my India was having such a great culture. I was also reading
an article in the newspaper which was related to 'swag jeans' \[Swag
jeans are the jeans which are even lower than the low-waist-jeans, so in
a way they show most of your 'behind'\].

<!--more--> They are saying Western countries are going to ban those kind
of jeans in their countries. I hear it a lot that we Indians are following
Americans all the time. We follow them in each and every kind of deed.
They say the new generation is very much influenced by the western
culture. Well I ask all my fellow Indians who is to be blamed? the new
generation? Get Out!!! It's not the new kids who are to be blamed it's
our ancestors. Our fathers, grandfathers, grand-grandfathers and
forefathers, because they were the people who first fell for the western
influence. If they were NOT influenced by the western culture back in
the history, then our country would still have been a country rich of
it's own culture. We have always been influenced by the western cultures
since ages; so why blame new generations. The new generation is just
following the legacy 'to follow the foreigners' which they have got in
heritage. And I must say that they are following their forefathers very
very honestly.

But as they say,"An old man gives good advice in order to console
himself for no longer being able to set a bad example." That's exactly
what our old men are doing. They are cursing the new-generation, because
they want to hide their own mistake of following the foreigners. If you
say this is not true, then I ask you that why was I fined in the school
for NOT speaking in English. I was punished because my past generation
believes that anything which is foreign is good. Our parents or the
people of their ages or beyond have always made us believe, that
whatever is imported is more worthy. We are just following our parents
like good kids. That's our culture.
