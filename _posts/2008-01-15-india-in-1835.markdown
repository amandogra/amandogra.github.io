While browsing through my mailbox I found this particular mail which was sent to me by Kamal Kahlon (popularly known as 'cchurlee' among his friends). This mail took me. I felt proud as well as ashamed simultaneously after reading it. I am pasting this image here, as I think it deserves more than it. Every INDIAN should read it at least once.

[Update (2016-03-23): I've come know that this image was a fake. I am not sure though.]
