<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">When I was in college, I used to have a classmate named as Atul Talwar. Through out the degree he wore only white clothes. White clothes, shaven head and a black bag were kind of his trademark. Many times, I asked him questions like why he always wear white and why he avoided sitting near girls? He just used to smile at me and say something like,"...because I am getting prepared. When a plant is small it needs fences and all kind of protection, but once it becomes a tree, it doesn't need any fence or protection". I don't know why but I used to envy him for the peace he always had on his face. I wanted to be like him, but I didn't had the strength to be like him so I loathed him. But he was always calm. <br /><br />He wanted to be buddhist monk. He was quite impressed by them. He was impressed by Swami Vivekananda. In the initial years of college, he used to have some traces of violence and arrogance (as he used to pluck hair from my face with his fingers and he used to get irritated by the comments made upon his personality) but as the time went by, as he became older, he became mature. He became more self-controlled. He became more calm. My enviousness for him also receded and I started appreciating whatever he was doing. He used to read so many spiritual books. He used to meditate in library, sometimes for hours, without minding how many people are there watching him. He never made a girl friend and was not even shy to them. He just needed them and they didn't use to bother him. He was intelligent, very good orator and at times competitive. He was always busy in himself. He was one of his kind in college. He had no friend and no enemy.<br /><br />Recently, I heard about him from one of my old classmates, that he has joined 'Rama Krishnan' ashram and has become a spiritual teacher there. Every evening he delivers lectures there on spirituality. He has become what he wanted to be 'a monk',&nbsp; and I who used to envy him is still struggling with 'What I want to be?' idea.<br />I still envy him.</div>
