<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Whenever we talk about the reformation of our nation, about the removal of corruption or taming politicians, we hear that '<i>iss desh ka kucch nahi ho sakta</i>' [Nothing can be done for this country].&nbsp; I ask this,"Do we really know what we want?"<br /><br />Everybody says that a change is required in this country, in it's legislation, in it's system. But what is that 'change' which is required? I ask you, "Are you really ready for a change? Are you really ready to leave aside the privilege of calling a friend of yours instead of standing in a long queue? Are you ready to report the police officer who is asking for a bribe instead of a challan? Are you ready to let your children wander from college to college while you could easily find a '<i>jugaad</i>'? Are you ready to stop looking for '<i>jugaad</i>'s of any kind? Are you ready to stop making fake medical bills or house rent receipts or fake travel allowance bills just to save some tax? Are you ready to stop stealing electricity? Are you ready to accept it that you are dumb instead of placating your teachers, when they give you a 'B' instead of an 'A'? Or Are you ready to fail a student who doesn't deserve to be passed and is the son of some 'Board Member' of you college? Are you ready to stop corruption which is inside you? Are you really ready?"<br /><br />No! you are not. None of us is. We are all waiting for others to change. We are all saying,'<i>sab karte hain iss liye mein karta hoon</i>' [Everybody else do it that's why I do it]. But they don't understand a simple concept, 'For you everybody else is world and for everybody else you are world'. We are trying to change everybody else, whereas it's ourselves who need to be changed. We want to change our politicians whereas we are not ready to change ourselves.<br /><br />Policians are not made from thin air, they are people who are just like us. If given a chance we all would behave like them. It's us who have created them. It's not our system which is corrupt. It's us. We are responsible for it.  They do it, because we let them do it. We find corruption an easy way for anything, so do the politicians. So why accuse them for that? It's totally 'double standards'. We are watching televisions at our homes and wanting for some miracle to happen and change India overnight. This miracle is never going to happen this way. We have to work for it.<br /><br />We have to work on ourselves. Like Mahatma Gandhi said once,"If you want to bring a change, be the change". We have to stand and demonstrate what is it like to be non-corrupt. We have to set the example. So that a they can see and understand what we want? <br /><br /><br /></div>
