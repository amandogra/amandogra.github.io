<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I thing 'being good' is over-rated. Being 'bad' is better. Because if you are bad, you get hurt less, instead you are the one who hurts others. You get whatever you want by hook or crook. Your conscience never bothers you. You don't care what others feel. Words like 'empathy', 'sympathy' are just to get your work done. These words have less meaning in your life. People don't expect much from you, so you don't have to work up to their expectations. You can say anything to anybody. People are either afraid of you or they just ignore you.<br />Sometimes I wish I were 'very' bad.</div>
